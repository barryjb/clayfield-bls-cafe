set up all social media accounts with the handle @sage&olive.cafe so your brand is identical and consistent everywhere and across all social media account handles which are your exact website address

add a mobile menu

add a contact page with map, opening times, phone number, email address and social media links

make box 1 a video of the cafe busy instead of image

make the images in each box for coffee / breakfast / lunch & dinner an auto and clickable carousel with all options for each

add a book now button to homepage which automatically makes a phone call when clicked / tapped

add an automatic booking system (same as that italian restaurant)

make headings (coffee, breakfast, lunch & dinner) links and create new pages for each that shows the full menu for each with images




video 30 seconds to 1 minute once per week making a coffee and explaining why it is a good coffee to be uploaded to the sage&olive.cafe youtube channel

post at least twice per week to sage&olive.cafe instagram and facebook accounts

start marketing to local businesses via facebook with coffee specials / joining local facebook groups / posting specials each week
